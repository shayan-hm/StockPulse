# 🧠 StockPulse  
**Data-Driven Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization System**

---

## 📘 Overview
**StockPulse** is an intelligent system designed to forecast product demand and optimize inventory levels for retail and industrial stores.  
By integrating **Machine Learning models** with **Operations Research optimization**, it provides accurate demand predictions and determines the optimal order quantities — balancing cost efficiency and service level.

The project was developed as part of an **Operations Research and Inventory Control** study focused on real-world business applications.
